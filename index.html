      <h1>About <span class="whiteText">Me</span></h1>
      <h2>My name is <span class="whiteText">Kasey Clary</span></h2><br>
      <p class="emphasized">I am a Des Moines native, Drake Bulldog alumni, tech enthusiast, traveler, combat sport fanatic, constant reader, podcast junkie, autodidact and all-around hobbyist.</p><br>
      <p class="aboutText">I've worked in the world of technology for a company called Dynamo since graduating college in 2018. I spend most of my free time designing and developing web applications, learning and applying new technologies.</p><br>
      <p class="aboutText">Freelance development is my side hustle, and I would love to help you out on any of your web development needs. You can reach out via the contact info here on my site!</p><br>
      <p class="aboutText">Outside of work and web development I spend my time reading, writing, traveling, playing guitar, building on my personal finance and real estate knowledge, keeping up with the UFC, with my friends, and my girlfriend Kylie. I'm also an active residential real estate investor here in Des Moines and have recently gotten used to living the life as a landlord and property manager. </p>
